## Example use case categories

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="AI Automation Software" icon="blocks">
    Interleave AI with reliable software in a way where you can run it a million times in the background without a human co-pilot. Code owns control flow (not markdown files) while TypeSafe handles the semantic decisions and language understanding.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Real-time applications" icon="zap">
    Frontier intelligence at real-time speeds (150ms) means AI can make decisions faster than human perception. Fast and smart enough to be programmed to play games or embedded into a UI.
  </Card>

  <Card title="AI Map Reduce over Big Data" icon="database-zap">
    100x cheaper means you can process giant datasets. Search for relevant information over giant corpuses, classify giant agent traces, and extract features to make predictions.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Universal Verification" icon="badge-check">
    Verify the input prompt, extractions, reasoning traces, tool calls, or inputs of any other AI. Detect jailbreaks, citation errors, hallucinations, mistakes, or other error-modes that other AIs or LLMs make at a fraction of the cost for the actual LLM call.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Harness Engineering" icon="wrench">
    Use Jev queries to make your harness smarter - model routing, semantic context retrieval, LLM error detection and guardrails, reasoning trace classification at lightspeed and a fraction of the cost.
