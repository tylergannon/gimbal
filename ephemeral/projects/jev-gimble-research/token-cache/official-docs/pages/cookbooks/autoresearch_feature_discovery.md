# Autoresearch feature discovery

> Runs an autoresearch loop that proposes TypeSafe questions, converts free text into numeric features, and uses model errors to improve a supervised CatBoost regressor.

*TypeSafe questions turn free text into numeric features for a supervised CatBoost model;
use an autoresearch loop to discover them.*

CatBoost needs a table of numbers, and a tasting note is not one. This cookbook builds the
table out of questions about the note, and none of them are written by hand. An LLM
proposes the questions, TypeSafe answers them for every row, and CatBoost trains on the
answers. The autoresearch part is what comes next: CatBoost reports which questions it used
and which rows it still gets wrong, the following proposal call reads that report, and the
loop runs again.

By the end you have a loop you can point at your own labelled text, a curve of held-out
error per round, and a table of which questions the final model used most.

```
tasting note
    |
    v
38 TypeSafe answers
    |-- 29 score questions x 2 columns = 58
    |     expected rubric level + answer uncertainty
    `--  9 noul questions  x 1 column  =  9
          probability true
    |
    v
67 numeric columns --> CatBoost --> predicted critic score
                                     held-out RMSE: 1.77 points
```

A score answer becomes two columns: the average level the answer points at, and how spread
out it is around that average. A noul answer is one probability, so it is one column.

The data is 2,000 wine reviews: a tasting note in, the critic's score on an 80-100 scale
out. RMSE measures prediction error in critic-score points, with larger misses counting for
more, and lower is better. Every number in the table below comes from the 800 reviews that
neither the model nor the loop ever saw.

| how the note becomes a score                            | RMSE     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| predict the average score of the training rows          | 3.09     |
| the same CatBoost, reading the note as word counts      | 2.47     |
| ask TypeSafe for the score itself, rescaled and shifted | 2.15     |
| 18 questions from one proposal call, no loop            | 1.87     |
| **38 questions after five rounds of the loop**          | **1.77** |

The last two rows are the loop. One proposal call, with nothing to go on yet, gets to 1.87.
Four more rounds of reading its own worst predictions get to 1.77. Most of the gain is in
that first call, and how much the four rounds after it add is measured further down.

PROPOSER_TASK = f"""You are designing numeric features for a gradient-boosting model that
predicts the score a wine critic gave (an integer from 80 to 100) from the tasting note alone.
The model sees nothing but the features you design.

Return up to {PROPOSALS} actions. Each action is one of:

- {{"op": "add", "target": "", "name": ..., "kind": ..., "question": ...}}
  A new feature.
- {{"op": "revise", "target": <name of an existing feature>, "name": ..., "kind": ...,
  "question": ...}}
  Replace that feature's question with better wording. Use this when a feature measures the
  right thing badly: too narrow, too vague, or worded so nearly every note answers the same.
- {{"op": "drop", "target": <name of an existing feature>, "name": "", "kind": "intensity",
  "question": ""}}
  Remove a feature that is not earning its place.

`kind` is "intensity" for something with a degree, or "presence" for a yes/no fact.
`question` is what gets asked about one tasting note.

An "intensity" question is graded against this fixed five-level rubric, so word it so that the
levels make sense:
{chr(10).join(f"  {i}. {level}" for i, level in enumerate(INTENSITY_LEVELS))}

A "presence" question is answered as the probability that it is true of the note.

Good features can be judged from the note's own words, vary from note to note, and carry
information about quality that the other features do not. Reviewers describe structure, fruit,
oak, length, complexity, and drinkability, and they also signal quality through word choice."""

## Setup

```bash theme={null}
pip install anthropic openai catboost numpy matplotlib ipython "typesafe-sdk>=0.5.7" cooksafe --extra-index-url https://pypi.typesafe.ai/
```

then set `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Every API call is cached to
`json_cache.json`, which ships with the cookbook, so a re-render replays these numbers
without calling anything. Delete it to re-run live. The numbers came from TypeSafe
`jev-1.12` and `claude-sonnet-5` on 2026-08-03. `propose()` has a second branch for
`gpt-5.6-luna`, which was not run.

The first code cell is the whole implementation: API calls, encodings, metrics, chart
style. It is there so this file runs on its own, and the docs site folds it away. Skip it
on a first read - the recipe starts under it.

```python theme={null}

```
1200 dev rows, 800 held out; scores run 80-98, mean 88.73, sd 3.17

one of the notes:
A Champagne that is very much wine. The structure and the richness are just right for a food wine, showing ripe acidity, flavors of plums and apricots, and balancing these primary fruits with a dense, complex structure that takes in yeast, maturity and a tight apple skin finish.
```

The loop reads the same 1,200 of the 2,000 rows (the dev rows) over and over, and keeps a
question when it helps predict those 1,200 scores. Scoring on the same rows would mostly
measure how well the loop fitted itself to them, so the other 800 are held out and scored
once, at the end.

## Two question types

A proposed question is one of two kinds, and the kind decides what number comes back.

* **`intensity`** becomes a `Score`, for anything that comes in degrees. Its five
  levels are printed below, and the column is the average level, so a note that sits
  between "moderate" and "strongly" comes out between the two.
* **`presence`** becomes a `Noul`, for a yes/no fact like whether a fault is named.
  The column is that one probability.

## The method

```
questions <- {}
repeat for each round:
    notes  <- round 1 ? 60 dev notes across the score range
                      : the 30 worst-predicted dev notes + the 30 best,
                        each with its score, this prediction and the last
    actions <- LLM(brief, questions, notes, importance and error so far)
    answers[q] <- TypeSafe(note, all new questions of this round) for every row
    for each added q:      keep it unless its column is flat
    for each revised q:    refit; keep the change only if dev error drops
    for each dropped q:    refit; drop it only if dev error drops
    out_of_fold <- k-fold CatBoost on the columns   # judges, and picks next round's notes
```

No question is filtered out before it is answered. All of a round's questions go out in the
same request, so one more question costs no extra request. A question that applies to one
row in ten will look useless in the 60 notes the proposer reads, and still be the most
useful column in the set.

k-fold means splitting the dev rows into k parts and predicting each part with a model
trained on the other parts. Those predictions do three jobs: they judge every revision and
drop, they pick the notes the next round reads, and they tell the proposer which of its
questions helped, by how far they have moved since the round before.

```python theme={null}
print("every intensity question is graded on these five levels:\n")
for i, level in enumerate(INTENSITY_LEVELS):
    print(f"  {i}. {level}")
print("\nevery presence question is judged true or false against these:\n")
print(f"  true:  {PRESENCE_CRITERIA['true']}")
print(f"  false: {PRESENCE_CRITERIA['false']}")
print("\nthe brief the proposer works from:\n")
print("\n".join(PROPOSER_TASK.splitlines()[:6]) + "\n  ...")
```

```
every intensity question is graded on these five levels:

  0. Not present in this note at all
  1. Barely present - mentioned once, in passing
  2. Present at a moderate level
  3. Present strongly - the note dwells on it
  4. Dominant - the note is largely about this

every presence question is judged true or false against these:

  true:  The note states this or clearly implies it
  false: The note gives no indication of this

the brief the proposer works from:

You are designing numeric features for a gradient-boosting model that
predicts the score a wine critic gave (an integer from 80 to 100) from the tasting note alone.
The model sees nothing but the features you design.

Return up to 18 actions. Each action is one of:

  ...
```

## The autoresearch loop

`run_loop` runs all five rounds and prints a block per round. An added question goes
straight in: its answers have already been fetched, and its importance will show later
whether it was worth asking. A revision or a drop takes away a column the model is already
using, so each one is tried first: refit with the change, and keep it only if the dev
error goes down. A refit costs no API calls, so trying a change and rejecting it is free.

```python theme={null}
run = run_loop(
    split, PROPOSER, ROUNDS, EXAMPLES, ENCODING, MIN_SPREAD, CHANGE_TOLERANCE
)

## Pointing it at your own data

`PROPOSER_TASK` is the only string that mentions wine, and `featurize()` takes any list of
strings. Editing that brief changes the proposal prompt, and the prompt is part of the
cache key, so the next run calls the API again for every round.

The request count grows with rows, not with questions: one request per row per round, so
100,000 rows is 100,000 requests a round. A revision counts as a new question, so it costs
another pass over every row. Raise the worker pool slowly. Eight is already enough to hit
a rate limit on a shared key.

## What the questions see

Five held-out reviews, one at each quarter of the score range, against fifteen of the 38
questions: the top eight score questions by importance, plus the top seven nouls.

Those fifteen rows are then sorted by which way the answer moves with the critic score.
Questions whose answer rises with the score come first, questions whose answer falls with
it come after the divider. So going left to right, from the worst review to the best, the
answers above the divider should climb and the answers below it should drop off.

```python theme={null}
X, labels = design(accepted, answers_for, ENCODING)
column_importances = importances(X[DEV], SCORES[DEV])
# an encoding gives a feature more than one column, so add a feature's columns back up
feature_importances = importance_per_feature(accepted, labels, column_importances)
ranked = sorted(accepted, key=lambda f: -feature_importances[f["name"]])
score_questions = [f for f in ranked if f["kind"] == "intensity"][:8]
noul_questions = [f for f in ranked if f["kind"] == "presence"][:7]
# ordered by which way the answer moves with the score, so the map flips halfway down
heatmap_questions = sorted(
    score_questions + noul_questions,
    key=lambda f: -polarity(f, answers_for, split),
)
ordered_test = TEST[np.argsort(SCORES[TEST], kind="stable")]
positions = np.linspace(0, len(ordered_test) - 1, 5).round().astype(int)
review_rows = tuple(ordered_test[positions])

print("the five held-out heatmap columns:\n")
for i, row in enumerate(review_rows, 1):
    excerpt = " ".join(NOTES[row].split())
    print(f"  {i}. {SCORES[row]:.0f} points: {excerpt[:100]}...")

The table from the top of the page, computed. All five arms are scored once on the same 800
held-out rows, and the first three skip feature discovery. One predicts the mean of the dev
scores and reads nothing from the note at all. One hands the note to the same CatBoost
through its `text_features` handling, which turns it into word counts. One asks TypeSafe
for the score itself.

That third one is a single `Score` per row over ten quality bands, from "faulty or
unpleasant" up to "profound". Ten because ten levels is the most a `Score` question
takes -
eleven comes back as a server error. Level 0 maps to 80 points and level 9 to 100.
Spreading the bands over the scale that way is not enough on its own, because nothing in
the question says where this publication's scores actually sit on it. So every answer is
then moved by a single offset, measured on the dev scores. That offset is printed in the
row label, and it is the only thing this shortcut learns from the scores.

Spearman is rank correlation, where 1.0 would put the held-out wines in exactly the
critic's order. The word-count row is CatBoost's own text handling, not a tuned
text-regression pipeline. All of this is one dataset and one run of the loop.

```python theme={null}
predicted = fit_predict(X, split)
text_predicted = fit_predict_text(split)

# ask TypeSafe for the score itself, one request per row
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as pool:
    direct = list(pool.map(lambda note: ask_score(TYPESAFE_MODEL, note), NOTES))

## Did the autoresearch rounds help?

Both lines plot the error of the question set at the end of each round, starting from
the first proposal. The dashed line is the cross-validated dev error, the number every
accept and reject decision is made on. The solid line scores the same question set on
the held-out rows, which the loop never reads. Each point is the set as it stood when
the round closed, so a round that only revised or dropped a question still moves both
lines. The feature map says what the questions measure; the error is what tells you
whether the rounds after the first proposal made the predictions any better.

The axis is tight: everything on it happens inside a fifth of a point, and every shortcut
from the table above sits far off the top of it. The dev line runs above the held-out line
the whole way, and that is a training-size effect. Each dev fold trains on four fifths of
the dev rows, while the held-out number comes from a model that got all 1,200. The two
lines move together, so the dev number the loop steers by tracks the held-out number it
never sees. The interval under the title comes from resampling the held-out rows, so it
says whether the move from round 1 to round 5 is bigger than the noise in 800 rows.

```python theme={null}
curve, per_round = [], []
for features in snapshots:
    X_round, _ = design(features, answers_for, ENCODING)
    per_round.append(fit_predict(X_round, split))
    curve.append((len(features), rmse(SCORES[TEST], per_round[-1])))

# the same held-out rows resampled 2,000 times, both arms scored on each resample
gain = paired_gain(SCORES[TEST], per_round[0], per_round[-1])
print(
    f"round 1 -> round {ROUNDS} on the held-out rows: {gain[0]:+.3f} points, "
    f"95% CI [{gain[1]:+.3f}, {gain[2]:+.3f}]"
)

fig = rounds_chart(plt, curve, history, len(TEST), gain)
display(fig)
plt.close(fig)
```

```
round 1 -> round 5 on the held-out rows: -0.097 points, 95% CI [-0.147, -0.050]
```

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/ts-docs/2NirYCl-v96cw05F/cookbooks/autoresearch_feature_discovery/autoresearch_feature_discovery.executed.2.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=2NirYCl-v96cw05F&q=85&s=8e122e0435a22f9f18f4a3d780f06e69" alt="output" width="945" height="599" data-path="cookbooks/autoresearch_feature_discovery/autoresearch_feature_discovery.executed.2.png" />

The held-out line falls further than the dev line does. Round 1 wrote its questions with no
feedback to work from, and the four rounds after it are worth 0.10 points on the held-out
rows, 95% CI \[-0.147, -0.050].

Round 5 proposed four adds, two rewordings and eight drops, and gave the first dev number
that did not improve. There is only so much to ask about a 245-character note, and by round
5 the proposals had tipped from adding questions to dropping them.

the 38 questions the loop kept: 29 score, 9 noul
the question behind the top row:
  note_overall_tone_positivity: "Setting aside specific descriptors, how positive is the overall emotional tone and word choice of the note taken as a whole (warm, admiring language throughout vs. flat, neutral, or lukewarm phrasing)?"
```

`importance share` is CatBoost feature importance, normalized so all 38 questions sum to
100%. It is not a share of rows, of questions, or of prediction accuracy. A score question
owns two columns, a mean and a spread, so its two column importances are added back
together before the percentage is printed. `note_overall_tone_positivity` accounts for
17.4% of the total. The fourth row is a noul: whether the note names a single vineyard or
some other prestige signal is a yes/no fact, so it was asked as one.

## Next steps

This run keeps the loop small. Direct extensions:

* Screen a candidate before paying to answer it. Treat the proposed question itself as the
  state and ask nouls about it: can it be answered from the source text, does it mean
  one thing under its criteria, does it apply to most rows, will it vary across rows. Send
  only the questions that clear all four with enough confidence.
* Prune correlated features. Measure correlation between encoded columns on the dev rows,
  cluster the near-duplicates, and keep the clearest or most important question from each
  cluster.
* Add simple baselines. Compare TF-IDF, character counts, and other structural features on
  their own, then append them to the discovered columns to measure what each contributes.
* Mix proposer families. Generate candidate batches with Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini,
  and open-source models, then merge and deduplicate them before any of them reach
  TypeSafe. Different families should widen the search more than repeated calls to one
  proposer.
* Compare predictive models and methods. Try linear or elastic-net regression, a support
  vector regressor, random forests, and recalibration where the downstream output is
  probabilistic. Check whether the discovered features help outside CatBoost.
* Add an embedding baseline. An embedding turns a note into a few hundred numbers with no
  question attached: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` runs locally, OpenAI's
  `text-embedding-3-small` is a hosted call. Append one to the discovered columns and
  measure whether it carries anything they do not.
* Match validation to deployment. Use chronological splits when predicting the future,
  grouped splits when related rows must stay together, and keep a final test set untouched
  by both feature discovery and model selection.
* Stop on a plateau. End the loop when cross-validated RMSE stops improving for a fixed
  number of rounds, or when it reaches a question or request budget.
* Run a longer search in an agent's Goal mode. Give it an explicit metric, budget, and
  stopping rule, then let it propose, evaluate, and refine more rounds.
* Check stability. Repeat discovery across seeds or data slices and keep the questions that
  stay useful, rather than the ones whose importance rests on one split.
