# Pre-parsed value extraction

> Uses regexes to find candidate emails, phone numbers, and amounts, then has TypeSafe select the requested span so code can normalize a verbatim value.

*A regex finds the candidate values, TypeSafe picks the one the question asks for,
and code copies it verbatim.*

The `find` and `pick` pair here is one you can point at your own documents, and three
worked cases show it in use: the address a sender wants their receipt sent to, a phone
number as `+14155550177`, and an invoice total as `1315.50 USD` flagged as a charge.

TypeSafe picks one of the options you hand it, so the candidates have to be found
first. A regex finds them, TypeSafe picks one, and code copies the pick, in three steps:

1. A regex finds the candidate values in the text. Tune it to over-find.
2. TypeSafe picks which candidate the question is asking for, and reads off any
   attribute the code needs downstream (currency, country, whether an amount is a
   credit or a charge).
3. The code copies the picked value and normalizes it.

Because TypeSafe only ever chooses among the spans the regex found, the value you get
back is one of those spans, copied unchanged. It cannot invent a value or transpose a
digit.

*The regex finds candidate values in the document, TypeSafe picks one, and downstream
code normalizes it and acts on it.*

## Setup

```bash theme={null}
pip install ipython phonenumbers "typesafe-sdk>=0.5.7" cooksafe --extra-index-url https://pypi.typesafe.ai/
```

then set `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`.

```python theme={null}
import os
import re
from decimal import Decimal
from pathlib import Path

import phonenumbers
from cooksafe import JsonCache, make_playground_link
from IPython.display import Markdown, display
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, Noul, TypeSafeClient

TYPESAFE_MODEL = "jev-1.12"
NONE = "none"  # the escape hatch on every selection: "none of the candidates fits"

# base_url defaults to https://api.typesafe.ai/ ; the env override points at another deployment.
ts = TypeSafeClient(
    api_key=os.environ.get(
        "TYPESAFE_API_KEY", "cache-only"
    ),  # cached re-renders need no key
    base_url=os.environ.get("TYPESAFE_BASE_URL"),
    timeout=30.0,
)
json_cache = JsonCache(Path("json_cache.json"))
```

## Helpers

`find` runs a regex tuned to over-find and dedupes the matches. `pick` is a
`Choice` question whose options are the spans `find` returns, so its answer is one of
those spans copied exactly, or `none` when no candidate fits. `classify` is a
`Choice` question over a fixed set of labels, used here for the currency and the
country.
`is_true` is a `Noul`, used here to ask whether an amount is a credit.

Every call is cached to `json_cache.json`, so re-rendering makes no API calls.

```python expandable theme={null}
EMAIL_RE = re.compile(r"[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}")
PHONE_RE = re.compile(r"\(?\+?\d[\d\s()\-.]{6,}\d")
MONEY_RE = re.compile(r"[$€£¥]\s?\d[\d,]*(?:\.\d{2})?")


def find(pattern: re.Pattern, text: str) -> list[str]:
    """Code-side candidate finder: recall-tuned regex, deduped, in document order."""
    seen: set[str] = set()
    out: list[str] = []
    for match in pattern.findall(text):
        span = match.strip()
        if span and span not in seen:
            seen.add(span)
            out.append(span)
    return out


@json_cache
def pick(document: str, candidates: list[str], question: str) -> dict:
    """TypeSafe selects which found span plays the role. Returns {choice, confidence}.

    The options ARE the candidate spans, so ``choice`` is a verbatim copy of one of them (or the
    ``none`` hatch) - the model chooses, code owns the string."""
    criteria = {c: None for c in candidates} | {
        NONE: "None of these is the requested value."
    }
    answer = ts.system_one(
        state=document,
        questions={"pick": Choice(instructions=question, criteria=criteria)},
        model=TYPESAFE_MODEL,
    ).answers["pick"]
    return {"choice": answer.choice, "confidence": answer.confidence}


@json_cache
def classify(document: str, question: str, options: list[str]) -> dict:
    """A small Choice over a fixed label set (currency, country, ...). Returns {choice, confidence}."""
    answer = ts.system_one(
        state=document,
        questions={
            "q": Choice(instructions=question, criteria={o: None for o in options})
        },
        model=TYPESAFE_MODEL,
    ).answers["q"]
    return {"choice": answer.choice, "confidence": answer.confidence}


@json_cache
def is_true(document: str, question: str) -> float:
    """A yes/no Noul. Returns P(yes)."""
    return (
        ts.system_one(
            state=document,
            questions={"q": Noul(instructions=question)},
            model=TYPESAFE_MODEL,
        )
        .answers["q"]
        .noul
    )
```

## Email: pick the right address by role

Four addresses in the headers. The body asks for the receipt to go to a personal
address instead of the `To:` billing alias, so the answer depends on reading the body.
Two questions here: which address gets the receipt, and which one sent the message.

```python theme={null}
EMAIL_DOC = """From: Dana Whit <dana.whit@acme-corp.com>
To: billing@acme-corp.com
Cc: orders@acme-corp.com
Reply-To: dana.personal@gmail.com

Hi team - please don't use the billing alias for this one. Send my receipt to my
personal address instead. Thanks, Dana."""

emails = find(EMAIL_RE, EMAIL_DOC)
receipt = pick(
    EMAIL_DOC, emails, "Which email address does the sender want their receipt sent to?"
)
sender = pick(
    EMAIL_DOC, emails, "Which email address did this message come from (the From line)?"
)

print("candidates :", emails)
# code copies the picked value verbatim and normalizes (lowercase); it never re-types it
print(
    f"receipt -> : {receipt['choice'].lower():<28} (conf {receipt['confidence']:.2f})"
)
print(f"sender  -> : {sender['choice'].lower():<28} (conf {sender['confidence']:.2f})")
```

```
candidates : ['dana.whit@acme-corp.com', 'billing@acme-corp.com', 'orders@acme-corp.com', 'dana.personal@gmail.com']
receipt -> : dana.personal@gmail.com      (conf 0.98)
sender  -> : dana.whit@acme-corp.com      (conf 1.00)
```

`receipt` is the personal Gmail address on the `Reply-To:` line, which is what the body
asks for; `sender` is the one on the `From` line. Both are copies of regex matches,
lowercased in code.

## Phone: pick the mobile, normalize to E.164

Three numbers, none of them carrying a country code. TypeSafe picks the mobile and
reads the country from the text; `phonenumbers` combines those two answers into E.164,
the international format that starts with a `+` and the country code.

```python theme={null}
PHONE_DOC = """Reach our San Francisco office at these numbers: main desk (415) 555-0199,
billing fax (415) 555-0142, and my direct cell (415) 555-0177. Call the cell if it's urgent."""

phones = find(PHONE_RE, PHONE_DOC)
mobile = pick(PHONE_DOC, phones, "Which of these is the direct mobile / cell number?")
region = classify(
    PHONE_DOC,
    "In what country is this office located?",
    ["US", "GB", "DE", "FR", "CA", "AU"],
)

# code copies the picked value and normalizes it with the model-supplied country
parsed = phonenumbers.parse(mobile["choice"], region["choice"])
e164 = phonenumbers.format_number(parsed, phonenumbers.PhoneNumberFormat.E164)

print("candidates :", phones)
print(f"mobile  -> : {mobile['choice']}  (conf {mobile['confidence']:.2f})")
print(f"country -> : {region['choice']}  (conf {region['confidence']:.2f})")
print(f"E.164   -> : {e164}")
```

```
candidates : ['(415) 555-0199', '(415) 555-0142', '(415) 555-0177']
mobile  -> : (415) 555-0177  (conf 1.00)
country -> : US  (conf 0.90)
E.164   -> : +14155550177
```

Nothing in the digits says which number is the mobile or what country it is in; the
words around them do. TypeSafe reads those words, and `phonenumbers` formats the picked
number as `+14155550177`.

## Money: pick the amount, classify the currency, flag credit vs charge

An invoice with four amounts on it. TypeSafe picks the total due and the credit, reads
the currency, and flags each picked amount as a charge or a credit. The code copies each
picked string and parses it into a `Decimal`.

```python expandable theme={null}
MONEY_DOC = """Invoice INV-2087.
Subtotal: $1,200.00
Sales tax: $115.50
Total due: $1,315.50
A $50.00 courtesy credit from last month has already been applied."""

amounts = find(MONEY_RE, MONEY_DOC)
currency = classify(
    MONEY_DOC,
    "What currency are these amounts in?",
    ["USD", "EUR", "GBP", "JPY", "CAD"],
)
total = pick(MONEY_DOC, amounts, "Which amount is the total the customer must pay?")
credit = pick(
    MONEY_DOC, amounts, "Which amount is the courtesy credit that was applied?"
)


def to_decimal(value: str) -> Decimal:
    """Copy the picked value and parse the number in code (US grouping/decimal here)."""
    return Decimal(re.sub(r"[^\d.]", "", value))


for label, chosen in [("total due", total), ("credit", credit)]:
    is_credit = is_true(
        MONEY_DOC,
        f"Is the amount {chosen['choice']} a credit or refund to the customer, not a charge?",
    )
    kind = "credit" if is_credit > 0.5 else "charge"
    print(
        f"{label:<10}: {chosen['choice']:<10} -> {to_decimal(chosen['choice'])} {currency['choice']} "
        f"({kind}, P(credit)={is_credit:.2f})"
    )
print("\ncandidates :", amounts)
```

```
total due : $1,315.50  -> 1315.50 USD (charge, P(credit)=0.01)
credit    : $50.00     -> 50.00 USD (credit, P(credit)=0.99)

candidates : ['$1,200.00', '$115.50', '$1,315.50', '$50.00']
```

The total due is \$1,315.50 and the credit is \$50.00, both in USD. The credit-or-charge
`Noul` answers 0.01 on the total and 0.99 on the credit, so the code knows the
sign of each `Decimal` it parses.

> `to_decimal` assumes the comma groups thousands and the dot is the decimal point. That
> holds for `$1,315.50`; in `€1.315,50` it is the other way round. Ask a `Noul` question
> which convention the document uses, and branch on it in code.

## Open it in the TypeSafe playground

A share link that opens the email thread in the browser, with the receipt question on it
and the four addresses the regex found among its options.

## Two limits

* A `Choice` question allows at most 255 options. With more candidates than that, narrow
  in two
  stages: pick the section first, then the span inside it.
* Finding the candidates is the part that takes work. Emails, phone numbers and amounts
  have regexes that cover them; a name does not, so its candidates have to come from a
  roster you already have, or from a named-entity recognizer or an LLM that proposes
  them. TypeSafe then picks the one the question asks for.
